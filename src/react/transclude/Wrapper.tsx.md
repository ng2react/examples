Assumptions:

1. The AngularJS component is a simple wrapper component that transcludes its content.
2. The React component should have the same functionality, i.e., it should render its children inside a div.

Potential issues:

1. The AngularJS component uses the 'transclude' property, which is not available in React. However, we can achieve the same functionality using 'children' in React.

Here is the converted functional React element:

```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent, ReactNode } from 'react';

interface WrapperProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

const Wrapper: FunctionComponent<WrapperProps> = ({ children }) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};

export default Wrapper;
```
